# AI-Face-Detection
A simple project that creates a bounding box around the face of the subject.

This project was made by me and my project partner Vanama Yaswanth in my 3rd semester while i was learning python and was a Beginner in AI.
It uses python3 and cv2 library in the code and "haarcascade_frontal_face_default.xml" as a pretrained data.
